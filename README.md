# Job Board

This is a CRUD implementation of a job board. The home page lists all of the currently posted jobs. Each job is displayed in a Bootstrap card with an optional image included above the information. Clicking on "details" will show the full job description. 

The search capability allows searching by full or partial words that are found in the Job's title, company, or description.
